/**
 * Part of a Schnorr-style protocol, which may depend on variables (witnesses)
 * for which another protocol is in charge of ensuring extractability.
 * It is usually part of a larger composition of fragments that form a complete protocol.
 *
 * <br>
 *
 * This is motivated by the following idea: Assume we want to come up with e Schnorr-like protocol for the relation {@code {((h1,h2),w) | h1 = g1^w âˆ§ h2 = g2^w}},
 * meaning that the same witness {@code w} simultaneously fulfills the two equations. <br>
 * The standard Schnorr-style protocol for this works as follows:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>The prover chooses a random {@code r} and sends {@code A1 = g1^r} and {@code A2 = g2^r} to the verifier</li>
 *     <li>The verifier responds with a challenge {@code c}</li>
 *     <li>The prover responds with {@code R = c * w + r}</li>
 *     <li>The verifier checks that {@code g1^R = h1^c * A1} and {@code g2^R = h2^c * A1}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <br>
 * Thinking in fragments, we identify three parts of this protocol:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The first fragment ensures extractability (in the sense of special soundness for {@link SigmaProtocol}s) of {@code w} by sending {@code c * w + r} as the response</li>
 *     <li>The second fragment ensures that the extracted {@code w} fulfills {@code h1 = g1^w} by sending {@code A1 = g1^r} and making the verifier check {{@code g1^R = h1^c * A1}}</li>
 *     <li>The third fragment ensures that the extracted {@code w} fulfills {@code h2 = g2^w} by sending {@code A2 = g2^r} and making the verifier check {{@code g2^R = h2^c * A2}}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Note that the second and third fragment share the same {@code w} and {@code r}. This dependency is expressed in this interface:
 *     a {@linkplain SchnorrFragment}'s trascript generation may depend on variables that are outside of its own control. We call those variables "external" variables.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     This approach allows for easy composition of fragments that depend on (some of) the same variables.
 *     However, this also means that {@linkplain SchnorrFragment}s are basically useless by themselves because they depend on external variables.
 *     To ultimately make use of a {@linkplain SchnorrFragment} in an actual protocol, implement a {@link SendThenDelegateProtocol} and use the fragment as a subprotocol.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Implementing classes are usually used as follows:
 *     <ol>
 *         <li>The constructor is called with some data that contains and depends on external variables (e.g., an Expression like "h1 = g1^w", where w is a {@link de.upb.crypto.clarc.protocols.arguments.sigma.schnorr.variables.SchnorrVariable})</li>
 *         <li>{@code generateAnnouncementSecret(externalWitnesses)} is called, where {@code externalWitnesses} is some appropriate assignment (corresponds to {@code w} in the example above)</li>
 *         <li>{@code generateAnnouncement(externalWitnesses, announcementSecret, externalRandom)} is called, where {@code externalRandom} is a random assignment of external variables (corresponds to {@code r} in the example above)</li>
 *         <li>{@code generateResponse(externalWitnesses, announcementSecret, challenge)} is called ({@code challenge} corresponds to {@code c} in the example above)</li>
 *         <li>{@code checkTranscript(announcement, challenge, response, externalResponse)} is called with the data generated above and {@code externalResponse}, which is the same as {@code externalWitness * challenge + externalRandom}</li>
 *     </ol>
 *
 *     This implementation shall be done such that the following protocol has all the properties of a {@link SigmaProtocol}:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>Prover generates random externalRandom</li>
 *         <li>Prover sends {@code A = generateAnnouncement(externalWitnesses, announcementSecret, externalRandom)}</li>
 *         <li>Verifier sends an appropriate challenge {@code c}</li>
 *         <li>Prover sends {@code R = generateResponse(externalWitness, announcementSecret, challenge)} and {@code externalResponse = externalWitness * c + externalRandom}</li>
 *         <li>Verifier checks {@code checkTranscript(A, c, R, externalResponse)}</li>
 *     </ul>
 *     using the standard (response0-response1)/(challenge0-challenge1) knowledge extractor.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Most {@linkplain SchnorrFragment}s will probably be implemented by extending {@link DelegateFragment} or {@link SendThenDelegateFragment}.
 *     To compose a bunch of {@linkplain SchnorrFragment}s into a {@link SigmaProtocol}, see {@link DelegateProtocol} or {@link SendThenDelegateProtocol}.
